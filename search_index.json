["intro.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Data Sources 1.2 Draft Disclaimer", " 1 Introduction The Children and Youth Planning Board Juvenile Justice Map1 is a project intended to empower the CYPB Juvenile Justice Taskforce with additional quantitative and spatial tools to evaluate the impact of juvenile rearrests in New Orleans. This document is intended to be a companion to the CYPB Juvenile Justice Map. This document was created in order provide readers with added context for interpreting the the map’s contents. 1.1 Data Sources In order to provide the necessary context for an appropriate interpretation of the contents of the CYPB Juvenile Justice Map, we will explore the data sources used to create the map. These include the following 2 quantitative and 3 spatial data sources: 1.1.1 Quantitative Juvenile Justice Arrest Data American Community Survey Data 1.1.2 Spatial Zip Code Tabulation Areas Neighborhood Statistical Areas City Council Districts 1.2 Draft Disclaimer Please note that this report is a draft. Please report any questions/concerns about the draft 0.3 of the CYPB Juvenile Justice Map and the associated documentation within this report to the author of this report.

["juvenile-justice-arrest-data.html", "2 Juvenile Justice Arrest Data 2.1 Initial Cleaning 2.2 Arrests per Date 2.3 Arrests per Juvenile 2.4 Arrests per Home Zip", " 2 Juvenile Justice Arrest Data This data source was compiled by CYPB-JJ from iJes. The derived file contained the Arrest Count information required to create the CYPB Juvenile Justice Map. All arrest counts were defined by CYPB-JJ. 2.1 Initial Cleaning The original version of this data contained 1,735 records from 946 individual juveniles. Because the purpose of this analysis was to assess juvenile arrests in New Orleans, we removed records of inidividuals without a listed primary address within the city. To do this, we created the following systematic process for identifying a single Primary New Orleans Zip for each juvenile who may or may not have had multiple home addresses listed in their records. Figure 2.1: Inclusion Criteria, n= Number of Juveniles, k= Number of Arrest Records Remove all juveniles who do not have a single record with a home New Orleans Zip Code Keep all individuals who do have a single record with a home New Orleans Zip Code. Keep all of their records for analysis (even records for which these individuals have a with a home address outside of New Orleans listed) and then: If the juvenile only has one home zip listed, use that as their single New Orleans home zip If a juvenile has multiple home zips listed, identify a Primary New Orleans Zip Code to associate with all of these individuals’ records through the following procedure: If a juvenile has multiple records with different home New Orleans Zip Codes: Include the New Orleans Zip Code that is listed most frequently for this juvenile as their Primary New Orleans Zip Code If a juvenile has multiple records with different home New Orleans Zip Codes that appear with the same frequency: Include the New Orleans Zip Code that is listed most recently for this juvenile as their Primary New Orleans Zip Code This process resulted the removal of 89 records for 80 individuals leaving a resulting 1,646 records and 866 individuals in the final data set. 2.2 Arrests per Date The cleaned data source contained 1,646 records with intake dates spanning the 18 month period of October 01, 2017 - March 31, 2019. Figure 2.2: Arrests per Date 2.3 Arrests per Juvenile The 1,646 records represent arrests of 866 individuals. The average number of arrests per juvenile is 1.83. 69.56% (658) of juveniles with an arrest had exactly 1 arrest record. 13.21% (125) of juveniles with an arrest had exactly 2 arrest records. 6.448% (61) of juveniles with an arrest had exactly 3 arrest records. 10.78% (102) of juveniles with an arrest had 4 or more arrest records. Figure 2.3: Arrests per Juvenile 2.4 Arrests per Home Zip Figure 2.4: Total Juvenile Arrests per Home Zip The following figures represent the number of Arrests per Home Zip. A Primary New Orleans Home Zip Code was derived for each juvenile in the Juvenile Justice Arrest data set through the process outlined in Section 2 of this report. The zip codes listed in the figures below represent these Primary Home Zip Codes. Each individual in this data set is only represented by 1 Primary Home Zip Code.

This survey in in many ways a spiritual successor to the long-form census and contains questions that have been asked systematically by the U.S. government since the 1790 census 2. In their own words3… The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year. Through the ACS, we know more about jobs and occupations, educational attainment, veterans, whether people own or rent their homes, and other topics. Public officials, planners, and entrepreneurs use this information to assess the past and plan the future… —The United States Census Bureau 3.1 Juvenile Population Estimates It is from this survey data that we can derive juvenile population estimates for each zip code. For the purposes of this project juveniles were calculated as individuals between the ages of 10 - 17 inclusive. Population estimates per zip code for the 2013-2017 American Community Survey estimation period are as follows: Figure 3.1: ACS Juvenile Population Estimates by Zip Map Figure 3.2: ACS Juvenile Population Estimates by Zip For further reading of ACS history, see census.gov/history/www/programs/ demographic/american_community_survey.html.↩ See more about the survey at census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/summary-file.html↩ "],
